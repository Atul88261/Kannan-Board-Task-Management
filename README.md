## Homepage

The homepage serves as the main dashboard of your Kanban board. It displays all your tasks, segregated by their status groups: To Do, Doing, and Done. This allows you to easily see the current status of your tasks at a glance.

## Task Card

Each task is represented as a card on the board. The task card showcases the task title and description, providing a quick overview of what the task entails.

## Add Task

You can create a new task by clicking the "Add Task" button. This action will prompt you to enter the title and description of the task. Once added, the task will appear on the board under the "To Do" column by default.

## Edit Task

If you need to make changes to an existing task's title or description, you can do so by selecting the "Edit" option on the task card. This allows you to keep your task details up to date.

## Delete Task

To remove a task from the board, simply click the "Delete" button on the respective task card. This action permanently removes the task from the board, so use it with caution.

## Task Status

Each task has a status associated with it, which can be set by the user. The available statuses are To Do, Doing, and Done, reflecting the progress of each task. You can easily update a task's status to reflect its current state.

## Responsive Design

This Kanban board is designed to be fully responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile devices. Whether you're using it on a large monitor or a smartphone, the user experience remains consistent and visually coherent.

## API Endpoints

For developers and advanced users, this Kanban board also provides an API with endpoints to support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks. You can interact with the API to programmatically manage tasks in your board.

For API documentation and usage examples, please refer to the API documentation provided separately.
